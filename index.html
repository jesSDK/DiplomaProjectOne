                    Kuromi (クロミ, Kuromi) is My Melody's "rival", who is a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a
                    black jester's hat with a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial
                    expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is Halloween (October 31st). Her
                    name translates from Japanese to English as "chrome."

                    Kuromi's appearance is also similar to those of cartoon characters from the 1990s such as Pichu from
                    Pokémon. Kuromi has become a popular character for the punk, scene, and goth crowds due to her
                    appearance.

                <h2 id="KuromiPersonality">What's her personality?</h2>

                <p>
                    Although she may look tough and punk, she is actually very girly! Kuromi enjoys writing in her diary
                    and is hooked on romantic short stories. Her favorite colors are black and hot pink. Her favorite
                    food is shallots, all kinds of meat, and in recent Kuromi merchandise cherries have been shown.
                    Despite being a villain, Kuromi is mostly into food and even cooks. You might call her a rowdy free
                    spirit.

                    Kuromi is the "punk" tomboy counterpart to My Melody. Although My Melody can get along with Kuromi,
                    Kuromi's feelings are more inclined to rivalry to look tough.

                <p>
                    Kuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as "Kuromi's 5." Other members include a purple cat named
                    Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named
                    Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion. They love riding their tricycles
                    and causing havoc at breakneck speeds, similar to the yakuza-inspired "bosozoku" girl gang
                    subculture in Japan.

                <h2 id="KuromiAppearances">Kuromi's Appearance in Media</h2>
                <p>
                    Kuromi is from the anime Onegai My Melody. In the anime series Onegai My Melody, Kuromi holds a
                    strong grudge against My Melody originating from small, innocent mistakes My Melody made when they
                    were children. She keeps a notebook which she dubs the "Kuromi Note" filled with over 6,324
                    instances of times My Melody has wronged her. These events are very minuscule (such as My Melody
                    eating the last pickled onion from Kuromi's school lunch tray) but Kuromi treats them as traumatic
                    events, and vows to get revenge someday. It is implied that these feelings stem from jealousy
                    against My Melody for being "cuter" than she is, and eventually turns to delinquency out of sheer
                    rage and feelings of hopelessness against the world.
